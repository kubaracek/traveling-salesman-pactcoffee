# Warning

I have done this in late 2013 or early 2014 (I Think). Most of the assumptions are probably invalid today.

# Why this exists

While back when I was working for PactCoffee we had a delivery courier (cyclist) that needed to deliver a coffee to households and offices around Metropolitant London.

This was my proposal / proof of concept to show management that his route could be precalculated.

## known issues
  - This solution doesn't respect obstacles eg. neither water (river Themes) nor buildings


# Implementation

My implementation uses a genetic algorithm called Ant Colony Optimization. The description is inside the app I created, here's a screenshot.
